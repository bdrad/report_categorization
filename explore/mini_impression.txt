IMPRESSION:
1.  Unchanged descending thoracic aorta intramural hematoma with persistent intramural blood pool measuring approximately 1.4 cm in size, which is supplied by an intercostal artery.
2.  Unchanged enlargement of the ascending aorta measuring up to 4.1 cm, with diffuse calcified and noncalcified atherosclerotic plaque throughout the thoracic aorta.
3.  Unchanged 2.3 cm left thyroid nodule which warrants dedicated thyroid ultrasound if not previously performed.
IMPRESSION:
1. Slight decrease in the left lung and pleural metastatic disease.
2.  Unchanged small right pleural effusion.
IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolism.
2. Slight interval decrease in scattered groundglass opacities and interlobular septal thickening, compatible with pulmonary edema which is slightly improving.
3. Medium right and small left pleural effusion. Small pericardial effusion. These findings are similar to prior and are suggestive of volume overload.
IMPRESSION:
No intrathoracic metastatic disease.
IMPRESSION:
Large left heterogeneously enhancing supraclavicular lymph node likely represents a metastasis via the thoracic duct drainage in the setting of retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy (Virchow node). No additional findings indicate intrathoracic metastasis.
IMPRESSION:
No intrathoracic metastatic disease.
IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolism.
2.  Improved soft tissue at the intra-atrial septa and surrounding the right coronary artery compatible with improvement of the patient's known Erdheim-Chester disease.
IMPRESSION:
No intrathoracic metastatic disease.
IMPRESSION:
1.  No pulmonary embolism.
2.  New moderate bilateral pleural effusions with bilateral ground glass opacities. In constellation, groundglass opacities are most likely secondary to pulmonary edema.
3.  Complete bilateral lower lobe collapse with impacted airways.
IMPRESSION:
1. No definite intrathoracic metastatic disease.3 mm perifissural nodule within right middle lobe (series 3, image 167) likely represents an intrapulmonary lymph node. Continued followup per clinical oncologic protocol recommended.
2. Thoracic aorta is normal in course and caliber.
